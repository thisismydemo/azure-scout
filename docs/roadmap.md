# Roadmap

*See everything. Own your cloud.*

This page outlines what's planned, what's in progress, and what's been delivered.
Community contributions are welcome — see [Contributing](contributing.md) to get involved.

## Current Release — v1.0.0

Released February 2026.

| Area | What's included |
|------|-----------------|
| Excel Reports | 170+ worksheets covering all 18 Azure resource categories |
| Category Filtering | `-Category` parameter to scope runs to specific resource types |
| AI / ML Coverage | 15 modules: OpenAI, AI Foundry, Azure ML, Cognitive Services, Bot Services, Search |
| AVD Coverage | 6 modules: Host Pools, App Groups, Workspaces, Session Hosts, Scaling Plans, Applications |
| Arc Coverage | Sites, SQL Servers, Data Controllers, SQL Managed Instances, Arc-enabled Kubernetes enhancements |
| VM & Arc Enrichment | Backup status, Site Recovery, Update Manager, Advisor score, Monitor metrics, Cost estimates |
| Monitor Coverage | 22 modules: Diagnostic settings, alert rules, DCRs, App Insights deep data, autoscale, workbooks |
| Markdown / AsciiDoc Export | `-OutputFormat Markdown\|AsciiDoc` generates portable reports alongside Excel/JSON |
| Permission Audit | `Invoke-AZSCPermissionAudit` with ARM + Graph checks, color output, Markdown/AsciiDoc export |
| Subscription & MG Completeness | Captures ALL subscriptions (including empty/disabled) and full MG hierarchy |
| Module Naming | Renamed from *AzureTenantInventory* to *AzureScout* (prefix: `AZSC`) |

## Near-term — v1.1.0

Focus: quality, reliability, and community onboarding.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Pester test suite | Full unit + integration tests for all public functions and key private functions | :blue_circle: Planned |
| PSGallery publish | Publish `AzureScout` module to PowerShell Gallery | :blue_circle: Planned |
| GitHub Actions CI | Run Pester tests on PR + push; block merge on failure | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Category alias documentation | Comprehensive table of all accepted `-Category` aliases and their canonical names | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Resource provider pre-flight | Warn before scan when required providers are not registered in a subscription | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Throttling / retry improvements | Exponential backoff on ARM 429 responses; configurable `-ThrottleDelay` | :blue_circle: Planned |
| `Invoke-AzureScout -WhatIf` | Show which modules would run without actually executing | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Non-destructive cache | Prevent `ReportCache` and `DiagramCache` from being overwritten on subsequent runs. Each invocation writes to a timestamped (or `-RunName` named) subfolder. Previous scan data is never lost unless `-Force` is specified. `Clear-AZSCCacheFolder -OlderThan <days>` for cleanup. | :blue_circle: Planned |

### Visual Dashboard Tabs (DarkBlue "overview-style" worksheets)

Phase 10 added raw data tabs (Cost Management, Security Overview, Azure Update Manager, Azure Monitor) that collect data into flat tables. The next step is to add **visual dashboard tabs** — styled like the Overview sheet (DarkBlue tab color, EPPlus shapes, pivot charts) — that summarize and visualize the data from those raw tabs.

| Dashboard | Charts / Visualizations | Status |
|-----------|-------------------------|--------|
| Cost Dashboard | Cost by Resource Type (bar), Cost by Subscription (pie), Cost by Region (column), Cost by SKU (bar) | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Security Dashboard | Assessments by Severity (pie), Findings by Subscription (bar), Defender Plans (column), Active Alerts by Severity (bar) | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Update Manager Dashboard | Machines by Platform (pie), Machines by OS Type (pie), Machines by Region (column), Machines by Power State (bar), Machines by Subscription (bar) | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Monitor Dashboard | Alert Rules by Subscription (bar), Action Groups by Subscription (pie), DCRs by Subscription (column), App Insights by Subscription (bar) | :blue_circle: Planned |

Each dashboard tab will:

- Use DarkBlue tab color (matching Overview, Subscriptions, Advisor)
- Be pinned after the Overview sheet group via `MoveAfter` in the ordering function
- Contain EPPlus pivot tables + charts generated by `Build-AZSCDashboardTabs`
- Only appear when the corresponding raw data tab has data (no empty dashboards)

## Medium-term — v1.2.0

Focus: depth, breadth, and multi-tenant scenarios.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Multi-tenant scanning | `-TenantID` accepts multiple tenant IDs. Authenticates to each tenant sequentially, runs the full extraction → processing → reporting pipeline per tenant. Supports combined workbook (with Tenant column) or separate per-tenant workbooks via `-MergeOutput` switch. Auth failure on one tenant does not block others. Builds on non-destructive cache (v1.1.0) for run isolation. | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Word document export (#22) | `-OutputFormat Word` generates a `.docx` report with cover page, table of contents, per-category sections with summary tables, resource counts, and key metrics. Suitable for client deliverables, executive summaries, and formal documentation. | :blue_circle: Planned |
| PDF report export (#23) | `-OutputFormat PDF` generates a `.pdf` report with cover page, table of contents, paginated resource tables, and headers/footers. Ideal for archival, compliance evidence, and stakeholder distribution. | :blue_circle: Planned |
| Cost anomaly detection | Surface Azure Cost Management anomalies in the Cost Management tab | :bulb: Idea |
| Bicep / IaC gap detection | Compare discovered resources against known IaC templates; flag unmanaged resources | :bulb: Idea |
| Resource drift reporting | Compare two inventory runs and report what was added, removed, or changed | :bulb: Idea |
| Azure DevOps integration | Inventory Azure DevOps organizations, projects, pipelines alongside Azure resources | :bulb: Idea |
| GitHub Actions module | Publish as a GitHub Action so pipelines can generate inventory reports without local setup | :bulb: Idea |
| Fabric / Power BI export (#17) | `-OutputFormat PowerBI` generates a flat normalized CSV bundle (`PowerBI/` folder) with `_metadata.csv`, `Subscriptions.csv`, per-module `Resources_*.csv` and `Entra_*.csv` files, and a `_relationships.json` star-schema manifest for Power BI Desktop / Microsoft Fabric | :white_check_mark: Done |
| IoT deep coverage | IoT Hub device registry, Device Provisioning Service, Digital Twins topology | :bulb: Idea |

## Long-term Vision

AzureScout aims to be the definitive open-source Azure visibility tool for:

- **Architects** — understand the full shape of a tenant before designing changes
- **Security teams** — identify misconfigured, unmonitored, or over-privileged resources
- **FinOps practitioners** — surface cost waste, reservation opportunities, and untagged resources
- **Managed service providers** — generate client-ready reports across multiple tenants

The tool will remain **open-source, PowerShell-native, and Excel-friendly** — no agents, no portals, no licensing fees.

## Completed Phases

All implementation phases from the original migration plan are complete.
See the [Changelog](changelog.md) for the full history.

| Phase | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| Phase 1-9 | Core engine, module loading, Excel generation, JSON output, Draw.io diagrams, auth methods, connection handling, permission pre-flight |
| Phase 10 | Specialized Excel tabs: Cost Management, Security Overview, Azure Update Manager, Azure Monitor |
| Phase 11 | All-subscriptions + full MG hierarchy enumeration |
| Phase 12 | ARM-only default scope, permission documentation, README overhaul |
| Phase 13 | 15 new Azure Monitor/Insights modules |
| Phase 14 | 15 new AI/ML modules |
| Phase 15 | 6 AVD modules + AVD on Azure Local/Arc detection |

| Phase 17 | VM + Arc deep enrichment (metrics, backup, DR, cost, advisor) |
| Phase 18 | Category folder alignment + `.CATEGORY` metadata parsing |
| Phase 19 | Richer progress indicators, clear permission error messages |
| Phase 20 | `Invoke-AZSCPermissionAudit` + `Test-AZSCPermissions` refactor |
