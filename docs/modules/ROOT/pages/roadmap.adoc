== Long-term Vision

AzureScout aims to be the definitive open-source Azure visibility tool for:

* **Architects** — understand the full shape of a tenant before designing changes
* **Security teams** — identify misconfigured, unmonitored, or over-privileged resources
* **FinOps practitioners** — surface cost waste, reservation opportunities, and untagged resources
* **Managed service providers** — generate client-ready reports across multiple tenants

The tool will remain **open-source, PowerShell-native, and Excel-friendly** — no agents, no portals, no licensing fees.

== Completed Phases

All implementation phases from the original migration plan are complete.
