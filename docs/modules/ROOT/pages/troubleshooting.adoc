== Common Errors

[cols="2,2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Error | Cause | Fix

| `Insufficient privileges to complete the operation`
| Missing Microsoft Graph permission
| Grant the required permission and perform admin consent. See xref:permissions.adoc[Permissions].

| `Authorization_RequestDenied`
| Delegated permission not consented
| Sign in with a Global Admin and consent to the required permissions.

| `Resource provider not registered` / `[FAIL] Provider: ... NotRegistered`
| Provider not enabled in subscription
| **This is expected.** Not all providers need to be registered in every subscription — Azure only registers providers for services you actually use. The corresponding inventory modules are simply skipped. Only register a provider if you actually use that service and want it included in the report: `Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace <namespace>`. See xref:prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites] for details.

| `No match was found for the specified search criteria and module name`
| Module not available in PSGallery or network restrictions
| Install the module manually. See xref:prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites] for install commands.

| `Get-AzSubscription returned 0 subscriptions`
| Identity has no Reader role on any subscription
| Assign `Reader` at the subscription or management group level.

| `Connect-AzAccount: interactive login failed`
| Running in a non-interactive session (CI/CD, SSH)
| Use `-DeviceLogin`, SPN with secret, or SPN with certificate. See xref:authentication.adoc[Authentication].

| `Token acquisition failed for MSGraph`
| Az.Accounts version too old or tenant configuration issue
| Update `Az.Accounts` to latest: `Update-Module Az.Accounts -Force`

| `Export-Excel: file is locked`
| Excel report file is open in another application
| Close the file and re-run.

== Debugging

Enable verbose debug output to diagnose issues:

[source,powershell]
----
Invoke-AzureScout -TenantID '00000000-...' -Debug
----

This produces timestamped log entries for each extraction step, module execution, and API call.

== Pre-flight Permission Check

Run the permission checker standalone to validate access before a full inventory:

[source,powershell]
----
$result = Test-AZSCPermissions -TenantID '00000000-...' -Scope All
$result | Format-List
----

The `Details` array contains per-check results with remediation guidance for any failures.
