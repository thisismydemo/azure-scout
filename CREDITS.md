## Fork Origin

AzureScout was forked from [**microsoft/ARI**](https://github.com/microsoft/ARI) at version **3.6.11** (October 2024). The original ARI project provided the entire extraction, processing, and reporting pipeline — including 171 ARM inventory modules, the draw.io diagram engine, Excel/ImportExcel integration, and Azure Automation Account support — that AzureScout continues to build upon.

For a detailed list of what AzureScout has changed and added on top of ARI, see [Differences from ARI](docs/modules/ROOT/pages/ari-differences.adoc).
